Write a Python NLTK program to check the list of stopwords in various languages.
From Wikipedia:
In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language data (text). 
Though "stop words" usually refers to the most common words in a language, there is no single universal list of stop words used 
by all natural language processing tools, and indeed not all tools even use such a list. Some tools specifically avoid removing 
these stop words to support phrase search. Any group of words can be chosen as the stop words for a given purpose. For some search engines, 
these are some of the most common, short function words, such as the, is, at, which, and on. In this case, stop words can cause problems when 
searching for phrases that include them, particularly in names such as "The Who", "The The", or "Take That". Other search engines remove some 
of the most common words-including lexical words, such as "want"-from a query in order to improve performance.
