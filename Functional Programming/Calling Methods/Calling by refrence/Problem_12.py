"""
Write a func to compute the distacne between two points and use it to develop another func that will compute the area
of the triangle whose vertices are A(x1,y1), B(x2,y2), and C(x3,y3).
Use these func to develop a func which returns a value 1 if the point (x,y) lines inside the triangle ABC otherwise a value 0
