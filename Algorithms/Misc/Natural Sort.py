"""
Write a Python program to sort unsorted strings using natural sort.
Natural sort order is an ordering of strings in alphabetical order, except that multi-digit numbers are treated atomically, i.e., as 
if they were a single character. Natural sort order has been promoted as being more human-friendly ("natural") 
than the machine-oriented pure alphabetical order.
For example, in alphabetical sorting "z11" would be sorted before "z2" because "1" is sorted as smaller than "2", 
while in natural sorting "z2" is sorted before "z11" because "2" is sorted as smaller than "11".
Alphabetical sorting:
z11
z2
Natural sorting:
z2
z11
