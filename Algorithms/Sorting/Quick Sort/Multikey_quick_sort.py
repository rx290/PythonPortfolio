Write a Python program to sort unsorted numbers using Multi-key quicksort. Go to the editor
From Wikipedia-
Multi-key quicksort:
This algorithm is a combination of radix sort and quicksort. Pick an element from the array (the pivot) and consider 
the first character (key) of the string (multikey). Partition the remaining elements into three sets: those whose corresponding character 
is less than, equal to, 
and greater than the pivot's character. Recursively sort the "less than" and "greater than" partitions on the same character.
